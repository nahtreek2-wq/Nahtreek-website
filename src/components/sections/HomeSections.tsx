              "What does NAHTREEK AI actually do?",
              "It turns a rough description — optionally with site photos — into a structured plan: what it understood, what to do first, what to watch out for, and the one question that matters most. 5 chats are free; unlimited plans cost ₹99/month.",

            [
              "How are professionals verified?",
              "Engineers and service pros apply with their credentials and experience, and NAHTREEK reviews each profile before it appears in discovery. Verified members carry a badge; Pro members are ranked higher.",

            [
              "How much will a service cost?",
              "Fees depend on the property, location and agreed scope. NAHTREEK AI gives you a planning starting point, and professionals share written quotes before any work begins — no surprises mid-job.",

            [
              "Does NAHTREEK certify engineering work?",
              "No. NAHTREEK connects you with qualified professionals and keeps the engagement transparent. Technical advice, designs, inspections and certifications remain the professional's responsibility.",

              "What should I do for an urgent safety issue?",
